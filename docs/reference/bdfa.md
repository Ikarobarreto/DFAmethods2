# Beta DFA

Calculates Beta DFA

## Usage

``` r
bdfa(data, dpo = 1, int = T, np = 91, overlap = T)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  is a matrix of time series

- dpo:

  detrending polynomial order

- int:

  logical. if TRUE integration process will be applied.

- np:

  number of point scales.

- overlap:

  logical. if TRUE overlapping windows will be applied.

## Value

Scale s, Beta DFA estimates
